## Introduction ##

**GohJasmin** is a lightweight, self-hostable dynamic DNS server. Just add an instance of [djbdns](https://cr.yp.to/djbdns.html) or dbndns and you have your very own dynamic DNS service with your own domains. 

(You could actually add any other DNS server to the mix. You will just need to write some glue code to export the dynamic data from the GohJasmin database into your DNS server. Thats not very difficult.)

If you are looking for a service to manage your dynamic dns records and have your hosts send their current IP addresses to, then **GohJasmin** might be for you.

_This is still work in progress! Use at your own risk._
